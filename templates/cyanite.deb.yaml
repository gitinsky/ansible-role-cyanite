## Cyanite configuration
## =====================
##
## Cyanite's configuration is broken up in
## different sections:
##
## - engine
## - api
## - input
## - index
## - store
## - logging
##
## Most sections are optional but provide defaults
## for a single host testing system
##
## Engine
## ======
##
## The engine specifies the behavior of Cyanite's core
## which accepts metrics from inputs, aggregates in-memory
## and defers to an index and a store when a time-window
## elapses
##
## The engine accepts the following options:
##
## *rules*:
##   Rules specifies which resolutions to apply to an incoming metric.
##   Rules consist of a pattern or the string "default" and an associated
##   list of resolutions.
##   Rules are evaluated in a first-match order. Resolutions are stored as a
##   string of the form: <precision>:<period>, you may use unit specifiers
##   for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks and months and years.
engine:
  rules:
    "web.*\.cpu": [ "5s:1h", "30s:1d" ]
    default: [ "5s:1h" ]
##
## API
## ===
##
## The API specifies the behavior of the HTTP interface which is exposed.
## The API accepts the following options:
##
## *host*:
##    Address to listen on, defaults to 127.0.0.1
## *port*:
##    Port to bind to, defaults to 8080
## *disabled:
##    Disable HTTP service altogether, defaults to false.
api:
  port: 8080
##
## Input
## ====
##
## Inputs are methods for Cyanite to ingest metrics. A Cyanite installation
## may have several inputs running, and thus accepts a list of input
## configurations.
##
## Each input configuration takes the following options:
##
## *type*:
##   Type of input, available for now are "carbon" and "pickle"
## *host*:
##   Address to bind to. Valid for both "carbon" and "pickle"
## *port*:
##   Port to bind to. Valid for both "carbon" and "pickle"
input:
  - type: carbon
    port: 2003
  - type: pickle
    port: 2004
##
## Index
## =====
##
## The index determines where metric names will be stored.
## Two types of indices are available now: "memory" and
## "elasticsearch". If no index section is present,
## An in-memory index will be assumed.
##
## The memory index takes no options.
## The elasticsearch index takes the following options:
##
## *url*:
##   The base URL for your ElasticSearch host, include
##   the ES index in the URL. Defaults to
##   http://localhost:9200/cyanite
## *es-type*:
##   The ES type to publish documents to, defaults to "path"
## *mapping*:
##   Provide a mapping for your type, defaults to:
##   path:
##     properties:
##       path:
##         type: string
##         index: not_analyzed
##       length:
##         type: integer  
##         index: not_analyzed
##         store: false
index:
  type: memory
##
## Store
## =====
##
## The store is where metrics get persisted.
## The only store available for now is the "cassandra"
## one.
##
## The following options are accepted:
##
## *cluster*:
##   A string or list of strings to provide cluster contact points.
## *keyspace*:
##   The keyspace to use.  
store:
  cluster: 'localhost'
  keyspace: 'metric'
##
## Logging
## =======
##
## Specify where to log. Adheres to the configuration format
## defined at https://github.com/pyr/unilog
logging:
  level: info
  console: true
  files:
    - "/var/log/cyanite/cyanite.log"
